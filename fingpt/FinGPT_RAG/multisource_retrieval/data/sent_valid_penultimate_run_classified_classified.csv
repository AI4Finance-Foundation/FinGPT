With full context: A man hangs decorations next to a banner showing Pakistan’s President Mamnoon Hussain (L), Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, before Xi’s visit to Islamabad April 19, 2015. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood Pakistan is awash with a tidal wave of Chinese infrastructure projects. The small town of Gwadar, for example, was a forgotten end of the earth, filled with dust-colored cinder-block houses that lined trash-strewn streets and ringed by cliffs, desert and the Arabian Sea. Yet this sleepy fishing town has erupted with development over the past few years. A Chinese delegation inaugurated its sparkling new container port in early April, as part of a deal by which China will build and have rights over the port. China has agreed to spend an extraordinary $46 billion in investment throughout Pakistan, far more than the annual U.S. aid budget for the entire world. This is now Beijing’s biggest commitment to any one country. Pakistan is also the largest recipient of Chinese weapons, and Beijing increasingly relies on it to help contain militants in China’s western provinces. Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) meets with Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain (3rd R) at The Great Hall Of The People in Beijing, China, September 2, 2015. REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool Pakistan holds a unique position in Chinese diplomatic circles. The Chinese state media describes Pakistan as China’s only “all-weather strategic cooperation partner.” Though it is the largest beneficiary of Beijing’s investment, it is not a client state, as North Korea is. Rather, in a neighborhood where many countries either distrust China, feel beholden to it or both, Pakistan is the closest thing to a real ally and friend that Beijing possesses. This means that China and Pakistan sometimes cooperate in ways that concern the United States and India. Washington and New Delhi worry that all this largesse will bring Pakistan firmly into China’s orbit. With subtle diplomacy, however, all four countries may be able to create a workable balance. The Gwadar port is just one example of China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative. This effort is by far the most spectacular example of Beijing’s strategic policy of combining aid, trade and foreign direct investment to build goodwill, expand its global political sway and secure the natural resources it needs to grow. Declaring that the Chinese-Pakistani friendship is “sweeter than honey,” and “stronger than steel,” Beijing announced last year that it would finance a 1,800-mile-long superhighway and a high-speed railway from the Arabian Sea over the Himalayas to China’s Xinjiang province. In addition, it would fund an oil pipeline route to the inland Chinese city of Kashgar. This network of infrastructure, including the Gwadar port, would help Pakistan grow, while pushing back against the growing power of regional competitors like India. Helping Pakistan so dramatically also fits into China’s overall economic strategy. With a deep-sea port in the Arabian Sea and a land route to remote western China, some of Beijing’s Middle Eastern oil could travel the short route through Pakistan, instead of 6,000 miles through the Malacca Straits to Shanghai. That’s the route more than 80 percent of China’s oil and natural resources now have to take. A China’s People’s Liberation Army trooper (L) and Pakistani soldier salute their countries’ flags at the start of joint military exercises in Abbotabad, 85 km (53 miles) northwest of Islamabad, December 11, 2006. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood The infrastructure projects allow China to invest its large, if dwindling, foreign currency reserves, and also buy goodwill with its neighbors. Chinese state-owned companies get additional work, and the many energy projects that are part of the deal offer strong financial returns. The initiative even has the convenient side effect of annoying India, Pakistan’s archenemy and China’s potential strategic rival. Chinese engineers have already begun digging tunnels and building bridges to improve safety along the legendary Karakoram highway, one of the highest paved roads on earth, which links Pakistan to China. In addition, China is Pakistan’s largest trading partner and allows Pakistan special trade preferences through a free-trade agreement signed in 2006, though the volume of trade with Pakistan remains a drop in the bucket for Beijing. As another sign of the growing alliance, Pakistan and China are close partners militarily, and their cooperation has increased in recent years. Pakistan accounts for more than a third of Chinese weapons sales. In just the past seven months, Pakistan and China have conducted joint military exercises in Pakistan, China and, for the first time, in the East China Sea. China also built six nuclear reactors in Pakistan over the past two decades and expects to help build at least two more. This is raising concerns with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an institution that supervises the export of global civilian nuclear technology. In the 1980s and 1990s, China helped develop Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program. Some intelligence suggests that Beijing even helped with Pakistan’s new frightening miniature “battlefield” nuclear weapons, and with its first weaponized drone. Many in India and the United States are alarmed about what they see as a China-Pakistan axis. They worry that China’s largesse means that Western nations will have little leverage to shape Pakistan’s actions on militants or nuclear weapons, or in supporting peace in Afghanistan. Another concern is that China would protect Pakistan when, for example, it refuses to cooperate with India and the West on handing over dangerous militants Delegations from Afghanistan, Pakistan, United States and China at a meeting in Kabul, Afghanistan, February 23, 2016. REUTERS/Omar Sobhani Washington should indeed monitor the China-Pakistan relationship closely, but the signs are not all bad. There is still much the world can do to prevent South Asia from splitting into two hostile China-Pakistan and India-U.S. camps, which is in no one’s interest. The West should cautiously welcome China’s lavish economic investment in Pakistan because more development helps stabilize the country, a positive result for everyone. Although China considers Pakistan an ally and a convenient access route to western China, China has broader interests in the region that may cause it to moderate Pakistan’s more worrisome tendencies. China trades more with India than with Pakistan and shares with it a long, sometimes contested border. So despite sometimes touchy relations, China cannot afford to really antagonize New Delhi. More broadly, addressing Islamic militancy is a serious goal for Beijing because small groups of Uighur militants have launched violent attacks in China and at times allied   with the Pakistani Taliban, Islamic State and others. This alliance means that China is likely prodding Pakistan to do more to crack down on militants there. It could also have a positive effect for Afghanistan, where China has become engaged in pushing for peace talks, and just announced a small security aid package. The United States, India and others should keep in mind that — weak as it is — Pakistan is one of China’s only real partners. They should engage both Chinese and Pakistani officials on economic development in the region, as well as terrorism and Afghanistan’s future. They should make clear, again and again, that Washington wants good relations with all states in the area. As long as India and the United States have a seat at the table, all four may be able to work out a satisfactory balance. In this complex dance, there are no simple solutions. ",2,2

China central bank warns high financial risks amid rising economic headwinds - Reuters https://t.co/p26nFHoGg5,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XZ151,"China central bank warns high financial risks amid rising economic headwinds Reuters. With full context: BEIJING (Reuters) - China needs to resolve outstanding financial risks, and must counter risks from “abnormal” market fluctuations that stem from external shocks, said the central bank on Monday, as Beijing prioritizes financial stability amid increasing challenges. Financial markets are highly sensitive to global trade situations and rising uncertainties in global liquidity, said the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in its annual financial stability report, adding that it will step up real-time supervision on stock, bond, foreign exchange markets to prevent cross-sector risk contamination. Bond defaults may continue, so authorities must prevent the risks of such defaults from triggering systemic risks, it said, while penalties on regulatory violations in the securities market would be increased. Beijing has stepped up daily supervisions and assessment on potential “black swan” and “gray rhino” events that may occur in the future and has prepared contingency plans, as downward pressure on the economy rises, said the PBOC. China’s household leverage ratio rose to 60.4% relative to gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2018, reaching the international average level and posing debt risks in some regions and low income families, according to the annual report. The central bank reiterated that it would maintain a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy, as well as implement greater tax cuts and increase the issuance quota for local governments’ special bonds used to fund infrastructure projects by a large margin. Looking ahead, the PBOC will tailor its credit supply to better boost the economy and strike a fine balance in achieving growth and fending off risks. “Overall speaking, China’s financial risks have been slowly resolved but the risks are still abundant, after accumulating rapidly in the past few years,” said the PBOC. It added that potential risks and problems will be difficult to eliminate in the short term. At the end of last year, 13.5% of China’s 4,379 financial institutions, mostly rural and smaller institutions, were rated as “high-risk” by the PBOC in the annual review of the industry. That compared with an about 10.58% of institutions that failed the PBOC’s 2018 test. It is also exploring development of an exit mechanism for unqualified shareholders of rural financial institutions, as well as market-based and diversified approaches for financial institutions to exit the market. Earlier this year, a rare government seizure of then little-known Baoshang Bank and the state rescue of Jinzhou Bank 0416.HK and Hengfeng Bank revived concerns about the true health of hundreds of small lenders in the country as China's economic growth slowed to nearly a 30-year low. China's big four banks - Bank of China 601988.SS, Agricultural Bank of China 601288.SS, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 601398.SS and China Construction Bank 601939.SS - face relatively large pressures to meet standards for their total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), said the PBOC. It will coordinate with other departments to roll out regulations to help those banks meet TLAC requirements on time, it added.",2,2

Fed's Mester says central bank can watch and wait on interest rates,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N31417E,"Fed's Mester says central bank can watch and wait on interest rates. With full context: [1/3]A person walks past a stall selling fruit and vegetables in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 28, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Faced with mounting evidence that loose U.S. monetary policy contributed to the breakout of inflation last year, the Federal Reserve now faces the risk it jumped too far the other way with its plans to fight price pressures through continued aggressive interest rate hikes even as the world economy wobbles. The warning signs of a policy overcorrection have intensified as the U.S. central bank's intent to ""raise and hold"" its benchmark overnight interest rate touched off a global asset repricing - stocks and currencies have fallen and borrowing costs for governments and corporations have risen - that some analysts worry has outpaced the Fed's ability to assess the impact of its policies. Broad measures of financial conditions have tightened fast in U.S. markets. Economists at Morgan Stanley recently estimated that between inflation and stricter Fed policy, dollar liquidity in the United States, Europe, Japan and China has declined by $4 trillion since March and is falling fast. The current path ""will lead to intolerable economic and financial stress,"" Michael Wilson, an equity analyst at the investment bank, wrote on Sunday. ""The first question to ask is, when does the U.S. dollar become a U.S. problem"" through global and market impacts that start to influence the American economy and lead Fed officials to reevaluate the pace of their monetary tightening. The Fed raised interest rates at its Sept. 20-21 policy meeting by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third time in a row, and indicated further large increases were in the offing later this year. So far, U.S. central bank officials insist nothing in the global marketplace has changed the game plan, even as analysts parse every adverb in policymakers' public remarks for signs that a lighter-touch Fed may emerge at next month's meeting. This reading of the tea leaves was on display last week when some investors interpreted Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard's reference to ""deliberately"" raising interest rates as a signal the central bank might slow down the pace of tightening. The shift in monetary policy this year has been the most dramatic in decades, with the Fed's policy rate rising a full 3 percentage points to the current 3.00%-3.25% range. While Fed projections released last month showed officials at the median penciling in another large rate hike at the Nov. 1-2 meeting, the group was closely divided. In interviews and public statements over the past week, however, Fed policymakers, far from concern over rattled asset markets, have laid out detailed accounts of what they got wrong on inflation over the past two years - including mistakes in their own policymaking - and their intent to fix it. ""Inflation is turning out to be much more persistent than we thought it was going to be,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on the sidelines of a conference at the regional bank. The list of culprits is long and includes things, like unexpected changes in people's choices over what to buy and where to work and the surprising inflexibility of U.S. supply chains, over which the Fed has little influence. But while those developments might have caused relative shifts in prices, Mester and others at the Fed now believe it was the joint evolution of monetary and fiscal policy over the last two years that created the more persistent increase in the underlying price level that the Fed is now trying to arrest. Pandemic-era fiscal policy was meant to create a ""bridge"" to help households and businesses through the COVID-19 crisis. But the more than $5 trillion in payments, loans and other aid, with new stimulus still being rolled out as late as the spring of 2021, built a world-class surge of cash that fueled purchases of goods and services that the economy strained to provide. Fed policy, oriented to fight the pandemic and ensure U.S. workers found a pathway back to jobs, remained loose throughout, with low interest rates that were meant to encourage spending in effect until only recently. Underlying, or ""core"" inflation, became embedded ""because we actually needed to raise our funds rate, or fiscal policy had to adjust to be less accommodative,"" Mester said last week. In the moment ""there was a feeling that policy wasn't too accommodative, because it was a huge pandemic shock ... One thing we learned is the economy is actually much more resilient than people thought it was going to be."" Acting otherwise would have been difficult. In March 2021, for example, when President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was enacted and the last rounds of stimulus checks were being written, the unemployment rate was still 6%, the rollout of coronavirus vaccines was at an early stage, and inflation was only beginning to percolate. By the Fed's preferred measure, inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.7% in February 2021, below the central bank's 2% target. Though it spiked in March to 2.5% and kept climbing, shifting policy at that point would have put the Fed in direct conflict with fiscal authorities who were still fighting to blunt the economic fallout of the pandemic - an uncomfortable position akin to what Bank of England officials are facing after the government of new British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced major tax cuts. That would have been an exceptional bit of foresight, taken in an era when uncertainty has ruled and just as Biden's presidency was taking shape. ""How could you not say we called it wrong. I don't run away from that,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in comments to reporters last week in Virginia. ""The implicit perspective was this was going to be a demand recovery problem. So you got to do everything you can to demand"" with policies to boost consumption and income. In hindsight, ""how much did we have to actually have to do?"" 'MOVED THE NEEDLE' The Fed now faces a version of the same problem: How long to wait for evidence that inflation, now running at more than three times the central bank's target, is falling before adjusting the pace of rate increases or even the endpoint of the policy rate. Those concerned about the torrid and insistent pace of Fed rate increases argue that inflation is on the verge of turning, and that continued aggressive rate hikes could push the economy towards higher-than-necessary unemployment - the jobless rate is currently 3.7% - and slower-than-necessary growth. ""They have moved the needle ... I am not sure they need to be as aggressive as they think they need to be,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics and an advocate of the view that much recent inflation can be traced to rising profit margins that he thinks will quickly reverse as demand wanes. If that proves true, and oil prices don't spike again, a closely watched Fed gauge of inflation could be collapsing next year, Shepherdson estimates. That's an argument Brainard also mentioned in a recent paper, suggesting that falling profit margins could ""make an important contribution to reduced pricing pressures."" But the timing is uncertain, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the ""clock is ticking"" on the central bank to show it can make progress on inflation in order to keep its credibility with markets and the American public. Even after listing the forces she thought could pull inflation down and mentioning the ""risks associated with overtightening,"" Brainard said the Fed remained singularly focused. ""We have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability,"" she said. ""We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down.""

Markets bet Fed is pushed to cut rates in coronavirus response https://t.co/4NDOpE6Kka https://t.co/8L2dYY8EYK,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2AO0MS,"Markets bet Fed is pushed to cut rates in coronavirus response. With full context: (Reuters) - Financial markets on Monday ratcheted up bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will be pressed to cut interest rates to cushion a feared hit to economic growth from the spread of the coronavirus, although one official cautioned against expecting the central bank to over-react to short-term market moves. U.S. interest rate futures surged to their highest levels since last fall as evidence the virus was spreading further outside its original epicenter of China spurred a global sell-off in stocks and panicked buying of government bonds. Wall Street recorded its biggest sell-off in two years. The federal funds futures contract tied to the Fed's July policy meeting FFN0 reflected a roughly 85% probability the central bank's benchmark overnight lending rate would be at least a quarter percentage point lower after that meeting's conclusion, according to the CME FedWatch tool. A month ago that was seen as a roughly 50-50 prospect. Contracts expiring in early 2021 FFF1FFG1 were priced for a Fed policy rate of around 1% or lower, compared with the current level of between 1.50% to 1.75%, where it sits after three rate cuts last year. Top U.S. central bank officials have signaled repeatedly that they see no need to cut rates further any time soon because they see the American economy performing well and it is too soon to judge the risk from coronavirus. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester was the latest to take note of the risk. In remarks to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Washington, she described the outbreak as a “big risk.” “At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring,” she said. But Mester pushed back against the notion that the Fed would be driven to act in response to jittery financial markets. “I just caution that you don’t want to over-react to volatility in the markets if you’re a monetary policymaker,” she said. Still, as the virus spreads, the resolve of Mester and other policymakers is likely to be tested in the weeks ahead. Monday’s stocks swoon followed a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. “The immediate risk is now about financial conditions,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “The real impact is small — but volatility, if the dollar rises, stocks fall, that is a direct hit.” In the U.S. Treasury market, the yield on the 30-year bond US30YT=RR - often viewed as a proxy for growth expectations - tumbled to record low of around 1.81%. Perhaps more tellingly for the Fed, the 2-year note's US2YT=RR yield slid to below 1.25%, the lowest in nearly three years, taking it further below the Fed's rate. As the shortest duration of so-called coupon debt - bonds with a maturity longer than a year - the 2-year note's yield reflects bond market investors' expectations for Fed policy. A month ago it was generally aligned with the fed funds rate. As concerns about the coronavirus have grown, however, the gap between the two has widened at roughly the pace seen last spring before the Fed’s run of three rate cuts between July and October. On Friday, a survey of U.S. purchasing managers indicated that activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors appeared to have stalled this month because of the outbreak, which upended global supply networks when goods production in China ground to a halt. Apart from that report from IHS Markit, little evidence has yet to emerge of the virus denting U.S. growth, although economists have begun predicting it will. Goldman Sachs on Sunday cut its estimate for first-quarter gross domestic product growth to 1.2% from 1.4% because of the disruption to supply chains. At NatWest Markets, analysts said they “agree that this Fed has a very dovish reaction function,” and thus would not be surprised by a Fed response before too long. But they question whether it will actually help much in the event the outbreak begins affecting U.S. businesses. “If a U.S. company (with a certain earnings stream priced in) can’t source inputs because overseas factories are idled with workers sick or locked down in their homes, a fed funds rate at 1.5% or at 0.25% is irrelevant,” they wrote in a note to clients on Monday.",2,2

The finance ministry said further measures would be announced to ensure large and medium-sized businesses had access to the finance they needed. The Bank of England confirmed the opening too of a program to buy short-term debt known as commercial paper, issued by large businesses which had an investment-grade credit rating or similar financial strength before the coronavirus hit.

Africa retailer Jumia suspends e-commerce in Cameroon,0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS1YK,"Africa retailer Jumia suspends e-commerce in Cameroon. With full context: JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Online retailer Jumia Technologies said on Monday it had suspended its e-commerce platform activities in Cameroon because they were “not suitable” for the African state. Dubbed “the Amazon of Africa”, the company founded in 2012 by two French former McKinsey consultants has grown quickly to become the continent’s leading e-commerce firm, operating in more than a dozen countries. Jumia, whose share price hit a record low of $4.96 after Reuters reported the suspension on Monday, said it would continue supporting buyers and vendors in Cameroon using its classified portal Jumia Deals. Cameroon’s economy is one of the largest in central Africa, but growth has been hit by a two-year separatist uprising in its Anglophone North-west and South-west regions. “We came to the conclusion that our transactional portal as it is run today is not suitable to the current context in Cameroon,” Jumia said in a statement announcing that its e-commerce operations there had been suspended. Jumia’s shares have tumbled from its Wall Street debut price of $14.50 in April and its last week’s third-quarter results missed revenue estimates for the second time in three quarters. With an e-commerce business similar to Amazon’s and a classified portal like Alibaba’s, Jumia sells its own stock, taking a cut of third-party transactions on its website. A source at the company in Cameroon said it had chosen to prioritize growth over profitability, which had not paid off. “We wanted to see how business evolved. We can come back, but for now we’re closing (to have) time to study the market,” the source, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The International Monetary Fund said in November that economic growth in oil-producing Cameroon was likely to slow to 3.9% this year from 4.1% in 2018 due to a subdued performance by the country’s non-energy sector. And U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he would end Cameroon’s preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) from January because the government had not dealt with abuses by the security forces. Cameroon’s government and military have rejected the allegations and have said that Anglophone separatists are responsible for human rights violations.",2,2

"NTSB cites Uber, driver in fatal crash",0,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XT2IL,"NTSB cites Uber, driver in fatal crash. With full context: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. safety agency on Tuesday faulted Uber for inadequate attention to safety and decisions in the company’s autonomous vehicle development in an investigation into the first-ever death involving a self-driving vehicle, which also cited the vehicle’s distracted back-up driver. The National Transportation Safety Board said state and federal regulators need to do more to safeguard drivers, noting a “lack of federal safety standards” for automated driving systems. The crash in March 2018 killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was walking a bicycle across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona. The crash prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry. “The collision was the last link of a long chain of actions and decisions made by an organization that unfortunately did not make safety the top priority,” NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said. The board criticized a series of decisions by Uber that it said were the result of “ineffective safety culture” at the time. The NTSB voted 3-0 that the probable cause was the failure of the back-up safety driver to monitor the driving environment “because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone.” She was behind the wheel and was supposed to act in the event of an emergency. In March, prosecutors in Arizona said Uber was not criminally liable in the self-driving crash. Police, who have said the crash was “entirely avoidable” and that the operator was watching “The Voice” TV program at the time of the crash, are still investigating. Nat Beuse, head of safety for autonomous vehicle efforts of ride-sharing company Uber, said the company remains “committed to improving the safety of our self-driving program” after making significant improvements. Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash’s cause, the NTSB said. The software did not properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian, it did not adequately assess safety risks, and did not address “operators’ automation complacency.” It also deactivated the Volvo XC90’s automatic emergency braking systems in the test vehicle and precluded the use of immediate emergency braking, relying instead on the back-up driver. Volvo found in 17 of 20 simulation tests the crash was avoided, the NTSB said. The board also cited the pedestrian’s crossing outside a crosswalk and Arizona’s insufficient oversight of autonomous vehicle testing. “SAFETY CULTURE” CONCERNS The NTSB urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require entities testing self-driving vehicles to submit a safety self-assessment report to the agency and for the agency to determine if those plans include appropriate safeguards. It said states should do more to oversee the vehicles. The NHTSA said it would carefully review the recommendations, adding, “It’s important for the public to note that all vehicles on the road today require a fully attentive operator at all times.” The NHTSA is also probing the Uber crash. The board said companies actually submit the assessments and some offer little useful information. NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said the NHTSA was failing to properly regulate automated vehicles. “In my opinion they’ve put technology advancement here before saving lives,” Homendy said. While Uber has made significant improvements, Sumwalt will tell a U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday he has broader concerns. “We remain concerned regarding the safety culture of the numerous other developers who are conducting similar testing,” Sumwalt’s testimony seen by Reuters said. In the aftermath of the crash, Uber suspended all testing of self-driving vehicles. It resumed testing last December in Pennsylvania with revised software and significant new restrictions and safeguards. Some critics have questioned the focus on a single pedestrian death when U.S. pedestrians killed in vehicle crashes hit a 30-year-high in 2018, to almost 6,300. The board is also investigating several crashes involving Tesla Inc’s driver assistance system, Autopilot, including a fatal crash in March 2018 in California. The NTSB last year revoked Tesla’s party status to the investigation after the agency clashed with Tesla and the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly ended a call. Sumwalt praised Uber’s cooperation. “I did notice that when I talked to their CEO he did not hang up on me,” he said. “It would be easy just to thumb it off. Blow it off. Say, NTSB, they’re wrong, they’re bad, and hang up on us. But Uber has not done that.” Tesla did not immediately comment.",2,2

With full context: Thinly traded Magenta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MGTA +14.7%) is up more than double normal volume, albeit on turnover of only 211K shares, on the heels of encouraging preclinical data on CD117-ADC, its most advanced program for the preparation of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. The results were presented yesterday at ASH in Orlando. An NIH scientist presented data that showed the first-ever successful transplant of gene-modified cells in non-human primates without chemo or radiation preconditioning via the use of a targeted single-agent antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Chemo and radiation are typically used to kill disease-causing cells before treatment, a paradigm saddled with severe side effects like toxicity and infertility. A single dose of CD117-ADC achieved the same level of depletion as four doses of chemo agent busulfan, enabling the successful engraftment and persistence of stem cells with the β-globin gene, mutations of which cause sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, without the toxic side effects. Vector copy number was stable beyond three months. The single dose of CD117-ADC depleted hematopoietic stem cells in the animals while sparing immune cells. #ASH19",1,1

With full context: COLOGNO MONZESE, MILAN (Reuters) - The head of Italian broadcaster Mediaset MS.MI is upbeat about reaching a deal to end a three-year legal battle with major shareholder Vivendi VIV.PA, providing the French media giant does not move the goalposts. Vivendi and Mediaset are locked in a series of legal spats including over the Italian firm’s plans to create a pan-European TV champion through the merger of its Italian and Spanish units into a Dutch holding company called MediaForEurope (MFE). On Friday, a Milan judge gave the two sides another week to settle their dispute over MFE after attempts to reach an accord ahead of the hearing had failed. But Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi told reporters on Monday: “If what we learned today from the talks is kept to, we are very optimistic.” He did not give details. Vivendi, Mediaset’s No. 2 shareholder, fears the plans to set up MFE would give too much power to the Italian group’s main shareholder Fininvest, which is owned by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Pier Silvio Berlusconi, son of Silvio, said Mediaset needed to grow, adding the creation of a large European broadcaster was the only sure way to achieve this. “Mediaset will press ahead with its European growth plans in any case and if it’s not via a merger or a Dutch holding company then we’ll do it in another way,” he said. According to sources familiar with the matter, Vivendi is in talks to sell back to Mediaset roughly two-thirds of its 29% stake in the Italian broadcaster but differences over price remain. Failure to reach a deal over pan-European TV plans could complicate Mediaset's efforts to tackle increasing competition from streaming services such as Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon Prime AMZN.O.",1,1

Sales of grounded Boeing 737 MAX gather pace at Dubai Airshow,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Z10L,"Sales of grounded Boeing 737 MAX gather pace at Dubai Airshow. With full context: (Corrects low-cost unit’s name to FlyArystan, para 2 and 6) DUBAI, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Boeing’s 737 MAX took centre stage at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday as airlines announced plans to order up to 50 of the jets worth $6 billion at list prices despite a global grounding in place since March. Kazakhstan flag carrier Air Astana said it had signed a letter of intent to order 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets for its FlyArystan subsidiary. Air Astana, which operates Airbus and Embraer jets in its main network, said it was confident in Boeing’s ability to resolve problems with the MAX. Global regulators banned commercial flights of Boeing’s fastest-selling jet in March after two fatal accidents. Plans for the jet’s return to commercial service have been pushed back to early 2020 as Boeing finalises software and training revisions that need regulatory approval. “We are making flying affordable for the people of Kazakhstan,” Air Astana Chief Planning Officer Alma Aliguzhinova told reporters, adding that budget carrier FlyArystan would start taking the jets in late 2021. The airline plans to hold 15 aircraft directly and may finance the rest through a lease transaction, she said, adding that Air Astana would not change the composition of its main fleet. Separately, another airline signed a firm order for 10 Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 10 Boeing MAX 10 jets, a person familiar with the matter said. The airline’s name was not disclosed. Boeing has used the past two major industry events to try to secure market momentum for the grounded MAX, which is seen as key to the planemaker’s financial health over the coming decade. A letter of intent between Boeing and British Airways owner IAG for 200 jets, which grabbed the spotlight at the Paris Airshow in June, has yet to be finalised as the European holding company discusses the fleet change with subsidiaries that currently use Airbus for medium-haul operations. In other business coinciding with the largest Middle East air show on Tuesday, Saudi budget airline Flynas agreed to buy long-range A321XLR jets. The airline’s chief executive had said on Monday that Flynas was in talks to exercise purchasing options for some or all of 40 Airbus A320neo narrowboday jets. Airbus unveiled a provisional order in Dubai for 8 of its small A220 jets from Air Senegal. Britain’s easyJet exercised options for 12 more Airbus A320neo aircraft. Also coinciding with the show, leasing giant GECAS was expected to confirm an order for 25 Airbus planes, including 12 A330neo jets powered by engines from Rolls-Royce, a competitor to GECAS parent company General Electric. However, there were no immediate signs that Dubai’s Emirates was ready to finalise a provisional order for 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, part of a complex set of interlocking deals driving fleet changes at the world’s largest international airline. The fate of the order hinges on negotiations over the larger Boeing 777X, for which Emirates is the largest customer. Emirates has indicated it wants to restructure the order after delays and sources say it could use the pending 787 deal as leverage.

BP expects to keep Azeri ACG oil output stable as Shah Deniz gas powers ahead https://t.co/dcNqW5BxVN https://t.co/a0y3sr6K0u,1,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN204242,"BP expects to keep Azeri ACG oil output stable as Shah Deniz gas powers ahead. With full context: BAKU (Reuters) - BP plans to ramp up production at Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas field and maintain stable output at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields this year, a senior regional official at the British oil major said on Monday. Both ACG and Shah Deniz are operated by international consortiums led by BP and provide significant revenue for the former Soviet country, though BP has had to work hard in recent years to counter ACG’s dwindling reserves. A BP-led consortium last week said that it produced an average of 535,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil at ACG last year, totaling 26 million tonnes, down slightly from 584,000 bpd, or 29 million tonnes, in 2018. Natural gas from the Shah Deniz offshore field was 16.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) and condensate output was 3.5 million tonnes, up from 11.5 bcm of gas and 2.5 million tonnes of condensate in 2018. “Both gas and condensate production will continue to ramp up,” Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP’s vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told Reuters. He said that daily production and Shah Deniz’s Alfa platform was 22.5 million cubic meters (mcm) and “this will remain stable”, while the field’s Bravo platform had been producing 33.5 mcm per day and “this will continue to ramp up throughout the year”. Aslanbayli said the consortium’s drilling at Shah Deniz II would extend for the next few years until production reaches a plateau of 16 bcm of gas and 120,000 bpd of condensate. BP continues works on slowing the natural decline at ACG, which is currently off plateau, and Aslanbayli said that the new $6 billion Azeri Central East (ACE) project will help to offset lower output from ACG. “The new platform will be technically advanced and will use automation to drive efficiency,” he said. Aslanbayli said that ACE is expected to deliver about 300 million barrels of oil by 2049. He said that BP’s other projects in Azerbaijan in 2020 include ongoing exploration drilling at the Shafag-Asiman offshore block as well as 3D seismic acquisition on block D-230 and plans to begin drilling at the Shallow Water Absheron Peninsula (SWAP) exploration area.",2,2

Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XS23C,"Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf airlines Emirates and Air Arabia spent a combined $30 billion at list prices on Airbus AIR.PA jetliners as the Dubai Airshow burst into life on Monday, while Boeing BA.N won a symbolic first official order for the 737 MAX since its grounding in March. Emirates threw its weight behind the Airbus A350 with an expanded order for 50 jets worth $16 billion, but shelved plans to order the slightly smaller A330neo as the Middle East’s largest carrier embarked on a more diversified fleet structure. The firm order, signed in front of reporters on day two of the Nov 17-21 show, drew a line under the A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest airliner which Airbus had decided earlier this year to close, prompting Emirates to order mid-sized planes. Under its original plans tentatively announced in February, Emirates would have ordered 40 upgraded A330neos and 30 slightly larger A350-900s. It decided instead to opt for 50 of the lightweight A350s, citing in part the impact on lower emissions. “Together with the A380, the A350 will give us more capacity and flexibility. We will be able to expand to new markets with these aircraft,” Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said. Analysts said the deal cemented the position of the A350 at Emirates after it canceled a previous order for A350s in 2014. But it also raised questions over production rates for the once highly profitable A330 family, which has been aiming for a new lease of life after switching to new Rolls-Royce engines. Shares in Airbus fell 1.5%, lagging a slightly weaker European market. Airbus builds 50 A330s a year or 4.2 a month. That figure could slip closer to 3 a month from 2022, one analyst said. NO ‘A350NEO’ The A350 gives Emirates greater room for growth than the A330neo though the airline has not definitively shut the door on the jet, an update to A330 models it has operated before. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied reports that Airbus is also looking at a future engine upgrade of the A350, something experts warn might dampen current demand for the jet. But Monday’s business left unanswered questions over the fate of 40 competing Boeing 787 jets also provisionally ordered by Emirates. Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates remained in talks with Boeing on firming up the order. But industry sources said that could come at a cost to Boeing since Emirates would in exchange reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year, which the airline complains is holding back its growth. Reflecting growth among budget carriers, Sharjah-based Air Arabia ordered 120 Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets in a deal worth around $14 billion, the biggest in terms of units so far at the Middle East’s largest aerospace event. Airbus and Boeing are pushing for order endorsements from customers that have been frustrated with plane and engine makers over delays in deliveries and engine issues. Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets due to production glitches. Faury told reporters on Monday A321neo deliveries should return to normal in 2021. Boeing is trying to turn the corner over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. Turkey's SunExpress THYAO.IS announced a $1.2 billion deal for 10 more 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered. It was the first firm MAX order since it was grounded in March and confirmed a Reuters report that a deal was close. British Airways-owner IAG signed a surprise letter of intent in June to order 200 MAX, dropping its medium-haul supplier Airbus, but the deal has not yet been finalised.",2,2

Leisure airline SunExpress, a joint venture of Turkish Airlines THYAO.IS and Lufthansa LHAG.DE, said in a statement that it signed the additional order on Monday and that the purchase was valued at $1.2 billion according to list prices. The airline expressed confidence in the jet’s capabilities and its return to service, even as Turkish Airlines has been critical of Boeing during the 737 MAX crisis. “We believe this was and is the right decision for SunExpress in order to survive and be successful... The economics and the ecological advantages of this aircraft are valid and confirmed,” Chief Executive Officer Jens Bischof said. He has the support of the company’s shareholders for a 737 MAX order, he said. In 2014 SunExpress ordered 32 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft which have not yet been delivered. Turkish Airlines took delivery of 12 737 MAX jets from an order of 75 planes before the aircraft was grounded in March.",2,2

Exclusive: Russia's VTB plans to expand grain business and then exit - CEO,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XT14H,"Exclusive: Russia's VTB plans to expand grain business and then exit CEO. With full context: MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's VTB bank VTBR.MM, which is expanding in commodities in a bid to create a national grains champion, will exit the sector once it has built up the assets in the next few years, its CEO told Reuters. Andrey Kostin also said in an interview that VTB plans to start trading wheat via its Swiss operation and that it is in the final stage of talks to purchase half of the Taman grain terminal on the Black Sea. VTB, Russia’s second largest bank, is now a major physical grain exporter after buying a local grain trader in August, and became the largest operator of Russia’s grain export terminals and other infrastructure this year. “Oil is going to run out one day but not the grain,” Kostin said in the interview, conducted last week and authorized for publication on Tuesday. “With that in prospect over the next few years, while the business is being built, we will still act as a player in the grain market.” In June the state-controlled bank asked President Vladimir Putin to help it create a Russian grains champion to curb the role of foreign traders and give the state greater control over exports, according to a June 26 letter seen by Reuters. However, Kostin told Reuters that once the business has been built up, VTB plans to hand it over. “We have not finished the expansion yet. We do not rule out building new grain terminals in the Black Sea,” Kostin told Reuters. “After we consolidate and wrap up this business, we will exit these assets,” he said. He did not elaborate on the options to leave the business or potential future owners. In its letter to Putin, VTB said it would need another two to three years to consolidate and acquire more grain assets. The bank plans to start trading wheat through its “fairly well-developed commodities trade business in Zug (Switzerland)”, Kostin said, adding that supplies to Russian traditional buyers - the Arab countries and Vietnam - have been its main focus. VTB is also in the final stage of talks to purchase half of the Taman grain terminal from Ukraine's Kernel group KER.WA, Kostin said. Global trade giant Glencore GLEN.L owns the other half of the terminal, located in Russia's part of the Black Sea. Kostin, who said he sees his bank as a “kind of investment fund” backing the state in big and complicated deals, told Reuters he believed the grain market “should be civilized, with transparent processes.” “Recently, Vietnam suspended Russian wheat imports due to its low quality... In the end the reputation of all Russian grain exporters suffers,” Kostin said, adding that VTB’s goal was to create trust between grain producers and buyers over margins and quality. “To achieve this, you need a qualitative infrastructure, serious and quite large players, including in trade.” This month, VTB exchanged debts with Sberbank SBER.MM, taking on the latter's 50 billion rouble ($784 million) exposure to steel and coal producer Mechel. The miner said in August that it had asked VTB, Sberbank and Gazprombank to push back debt payments to 2024-2026 from 2020-2022. The debt exchange deal left VTB and Gazprombank as Mechel’s two biggest creditors. Mechel has also agreed to pay around 30 billion rubles for Gazprombank’s 34% stake in the Elga coal project and needs to find cash to pay for it. “We said this from the very beginning: we don’t want to manage Mechel. Looking into the future, Mechel is quite an effective company,” Kostin said. VTB does not plan to give Mechel a loan to buy Gazprombank’s stake in Elga, he said. VTB also holds a 22% stake in En+ Group ENPLq.L, after the bank became part of the deal helping En+ avert U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controlled the company, last year. The sanctions were lifted in early 2019. Kostin said that VTB may consider selling its stake in En+ once the company’s shares rise in price from the current $9 per share, adding that the bank may also consider selling its En+ stake to another state entity if such an opportunity arises.",2,2

Condor, which filed for investor protection proceedings - which requires that a business can still be saved - made adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 57 million euros ($63 million) in the last fiscal year. Its adjusted EBIT margin stood at about 3.4%, compared with 7.9% at larger rival Lufthansa. “Healthy airlines need an 8% EBIT margin.

NYC pension leader targets three utilities over emissions plans,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1XU1G9,"NYC pension leader targets three utilities over emissions plans. With full context: BOSTON (Reuters) - New York City’s top pension official has called on three major U.S. utilities to name independent board chairs, pressuring them to “decarbonize” their operations by 2050 and underscoring how power companies have split on whether to set such goals. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees about $208 billion in retirement assets, recently filed shareholder resolutions at Southern Co, Duke Energy Corp and Dominion Energy Inc. The resolutions call for shareholder votes on whether to name independent individuals to chair boards currently led by the chief executive of each company. The change would be “useful to oversee the strategic transformation” of the companies to operate in a low-carbon economy, according to the resolutions, seen by Reuters. U.S. power utilities have largely embraced the idea of cutting emissions to slow climate change, but have split on what exact targets to spell out. A number of utilities, including Xcel Energy Inc and NRG Energy Inc, plan to end emissions by 2050 by using more solar or wind power, retiring coal-burning plants, or reaching “net-zero emissions” with offsets like restoring forests to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Some experts have questioned, however, if new technologies for nuclear power, battery storage or carbon capture will be ready in time to make a 2050 target realistic. (bit.ly/35cRFik) Southern and Dominion have both outlined plans to reduce carbon emissions but have not pledged to end them by 2050. To achieve such a state, “technology will have to evolve beyond where we are today,” Dominion CEO and Chairman Thomas Farrell said at a March investor meeting. A Dominion spokesman said the company is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. A Southern company spokesman said it is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. “We regularly engage with our shareholders and look forward to having a dialogue regarding these matters as well,” said the spokesman. Duke said in September it aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Stringer’s proposed resolution acknowledges the step but notes the utility’s continued spending on natural gas infrastructure. A Duke spokesman said the utility is reviewing the proposal. The majority of S&P 500 companies have an independent board chair, according to Stringer’s office, viewed as a way to improve corporate oversight. Calls to separate the roles of chair and CEO have become a flashpoint at some annual meetings, such as at JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose leader, Jamie Dimon, won bruising votes to keep both roles.[reut.rs/359MIqK] The resolutions mark an escalation from the approach Stringer and other investors took for the 2019 proxy season, when they only requested utilities move to net-zero emissions by 2050.[nL1N20M1X7]",2,2

Replacing Pratt engines in IndiGo fleet by end of January a challenge: CEO,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N27Y2EW,"Replacing Pratt engines in IndiGo fleet by end of January a challenge: CEO. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Replacing all Pratt & Whitney engines on IndiGo’s fleet of almost 100 Airbus planes by Jan. 31, as ordered by India’s aviation watchdog, will be challenging but the airline aims to complete the work, its chief executive officer said on Monday. India's aviation regulator on Nov. 1 ordered IndiGo INGL.NS to replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, following recent inflight engine shutdowns that caused ""serious concern"". “It’s a challenge. But we have every intention of meeting it. Pratt is helping us and we are trying to make that work as fast as we can,” Ronojoy Dutta, IndiGo CEO, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Dubai airshow. Low cost carrier IndiGo is Airbus' AIR.PA biggest client for A320neo planes, and while the United Technologies' UTX.N P&W engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times. In June, IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, dropped P&W in favor of French-U.S. engine venture CFM by agreeing a record $20 billion deal for more than 600 engines to power Airbus jets already on order. In October IndiGo placed an order for another 300 A320neo-family jets but it has yet to decide the engine provider - P&W or CFM, which is jointly owned by France's Safran SAF.PA and General Electric GE.N of the United States. “We will be talking to both Pratt and CFM, whoever has the best offer we will give it to them,” Dutta said. IndiGo is focused on growing its international routes and the plane order includes a long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family, A321XLR which will provide the airline with “a lot of growth”, Dutta said. He said ordering widebodies was a distant dream for IndiGo and a part of its five-year plan but no decision had been finalised. Dutta also said that a dispute between the airline’s two promoters and largest shareholders, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, was having no impact on the company. “Both promoters are very much unified in their strategy for expansion. Let’s grow fast, let’s expand international, they agree with that completely,” Dutta said.",2,0

UAE says Emirates pilots did not monitor settings in 2016 crash,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2A64DR,"UAE says Emirates pilots did not monitor settings in 2016 crash. With full context: Feb 6 (Reuters) - Pilots of an Emirates passenger jet that crashed in 2016 while attempting to abort a landing in Dubai failed to notice that the Boeing 777’s engine thrust settings remained too low and cut short a procedure, investigators said on Thursday. All 300 passengers and crew were safely evacuated but a firefighter died tackling flames after the Boeing 777-300, arriving from India, caught fire after skidding along the Dubai airport runway on its fuselage in August 2016. The Federal Aviation Authority said pilots of flight EK521 tried to abort the landing after the plane’s main wheels had already touched down, cutting off access to full engine power. “The flight crew did not effectively scan and monitor the primary flight instrumentation parameters during the landing and the attempted go-around,” it said in a final report. It recommended that Emirates enhance go-around training for its pilots and that manufacturer Boeing enhance its crew alerting system and manual to deal with such eventualities. None of the parties concerned was immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Jason Neely)",2,2

UPDATE 1-BT will maintain ties with skills group if it drops Prince Andrew as patron,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2802U4,"UPDATE 1-BT will maintain ties with skills group if it drops Prince Andrew as patron. With full context: LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s BT has told a company promoting digital skills it would continue working with it if it dropped Prince Andrew as a patron. The British royal has been engulfed in a growing scandal since he gave a TV interview on Saturday to discuss his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Andrew denied an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by Epstein but said he did not regret the friendship. He has also been criticized for not showing compassion for his victims. BT, one of Britain’s oldest companies and its largest broadband provider, said it was reviewing its relationship with iDEA, a programme that helps develop digital, enterprise and employability skills. Prince Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, is the company’s patron. “In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage.” Several major companies have also sought to distance themselves from the British royal. Bank Standard Chartered said it would not renew its sponsorship of Andrew’s Pitch@Palace charity while AstraZeneca said its three-year partnership was under review. In Britain, royal patronage is usually considered an honor and a boost for charities.",2,2
UPDATE 1-Italian airline Alitalia's rescue in doubt as Atlantia backtracks,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Z66L,"UPDATE 1-Italian airline Alitalia's rescue in doubt as Atlantia backtracks. With full context: MILAN (Reuters) - Italian infrastructure group Atlantia ATL.MI said on Tuesday it was not ready to join a consortium led by Italian railway group Ferrovie dello Stato to rescue loss-making carrier Alitalia, casting a shadow on the entire project. After months of negotiations and with just one day left before a deadline expires, the group controlled by the Benetton family said that the conditions did not exist yet for it to join a consortium working on Alitalia. Atlantia added, however, it remained available to engage in negotiations to seek for an industrial partner for the carrier. A deadline to present a binding offer for Alitalia expires on Thursday, after being postponed several times. Loss-making Alitalia has been run by special administrators since May 2017 and talks led by Ferrovie have been going on for a year without a deal. The carrier, which is burning through its cash reserves, is expected to finish its money at the end of this year. Ferrovie and Atlantia have been in talks with both U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and, recently, with German airline Lufthansa LHAG.DE. Delta said it was ready to invest 100 million euros ($111 million) in the Italian carrier but sources had said it did not agree with Ferrovie and Atlantia over the development of the Italian carrier’s long-haul business. On the other hand, Lufthansa said it was prepared to set up a commercial partnership with the Italian carrier but did not want to take a stake in the group before it has gone through a complete restructuring. “We will not invest in current Alitalia, but we are interested being a commercial partner,” said Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr at an event in Berlin on Tuesday. Italian daily La Repubblica on Tuesday said the airline could be nationalized for some years before being sold. Analysts calculate that Italian taxpayers have spent more than 9 billion euros to support Alitalia, which has undergone two previous failed rescue attempts.",2,2

WRAPUP-Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N27Y4IP,"WRAPUP-Airbus dominates second day of Dubai show as Boeing wins MAX order. With full context: DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf airlines Emirates and Air Arabia spent a combined $30 billion at list prices on Airbus AIR.PA jetliners as the Dubai Airshow burst into life on Monday, while Boeing BA.N won a symbolic first official order for the 737 MAX since its grounding in March. Emirates threw its weight behind the Airbus A350 with an expanded order for 50 jets worth $16 billion, but shelved plans to order the slightly smaller A330neo as the Middle East’s largest carrier embarked on a more diversified fleet structure. The firm order, signed in front of reporters on day two of the Nov 17-21 show, drew a line under the A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest airliner which Airbus had decided earlier this year to close, prompting Emirates to order mid-sized planes. Under its original plans tentatively announced in February, Emirates would have ordered 40 upgraded A330neos and 30 slightly larger A350-900s. It decided instead to opt for 50 of the lightweight A350s, citing in part the impact on lower emissions. “Together with the A380, the A350 will give us more capacity and flexibility. We will be able to expand to new markets with these aircraft,” Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said. Analysts said the deal cemented the position of the A350 at Emirates after it canceled a previous order for A350s in 2014. But it also raised questions over production rates for the once highly profitable A330 family, which has been aiming for a new lease of life after switching to new Rolls-Royce engines. Shares in Airbus fell 1.5%, lagging a slightly weaker European market. Airbus builds 50 A330s a year or 4.2 a month. That figure could slip closer to 3 a month from 2022, one analyst said. NO ‘A350NEO’ The A350 gives Emirates greater room for growth than the A330neo though the airline has not definitively shut the door on the jet, an update to A330 models it has operated before. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury denied reports that Airbus is also looking at a future engine upgrade of the A350, something experts warn might dampen current demand for the jet. But Monday’s business left unanswered questions over the fate of 40 competing Boeing 787 jets also provisionally ordered by Emirates. Sheikh Ahmed said Emirates remained in talks with Boeing on firming up the order. But industry sources said that could come at a cost to Boeing since Emirates would in exchange reduce an order for 150 Boeing 777X after deliveries were pushed back by a year, which the airline complains is holding back its growth. Reflecting growth among budget carriers, Sharjah-based Air Arabia ordered 120 Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets in a deal worth around $14 billion, the biggest in terms of units so far at the Middle East’s largest aerospace event. Airbus and Boeing are pushing for order endorsements from customers that have been frustrated with plane and engine makers over delays in deliveries and engine issues. Airbus last month cut its full-year delivery goal for commercial jets due to production glitches. Faury told reporters on Monday A321neo deliveries should return to normal in 2021. Boeing is trying to turn the corner over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people within a span of five months. Turkey's SunExpress THYAO.IS announced a $1.2 billion deal for 10 more 737 MAX 8 aircraft, on top of 32 already ordered. It was the first firm MAX order since it was grounded in March and confirmed a Reuters report that a deal was close. British Airways-owner IAG signed a surprise letter of intent in June to order 200 MAX, dropping its medium-haul supplier Airbus, but the deal has not yet been finalised.",2,2

With full context: NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. T.N on Tuesday announced a $5.5 billion term-loan agreement, which it said would give the company ""financial flexibility"" during the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. telecoms and media giant also reaffirmed its commitment to pay a dividend, which helped send its shares up 2.8% in morning trading. AT&T has been targeted by shareholder activists over its large debt load, accumulated over a buying spree that transformed it into a media and telecoms conglomerate. It said on its investor page that the new loan agreement, with five banks, would “provide additional financial flexibility to an already strong cash position.” AT&T spent $85 billion on Time Warner in 2018. It bought satellite TV service DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015, but the unit has continued to bleed customers. Under pressure from shareholder Elliott Management, AT&T announced a strategic plan in October to sell up to $10 billion worth of businesses in three years. AT&T closed 2019 by reducing its debt by $20.3 billion. AT&T currently holds about $151 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2019. Last month, AT&T stopped its $4 billion share repurchase plan as it re-evaluated the impact of the coronavirus on its business.",2,2

Euro zone to consider credit line from bailout fund to fight coronavirus https://t.co/aHTraPoyIK https://t.co/Rra8KyLRGy,2,Seeking Alpha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2BH53C,"Euro zone to consider credit line from bailout fund to fight coronavirus. With full context: * ECCL credit line for most euro zone countries under discussion * Credit line would pave the way for unlimited ECB bond-buying * ESM involvement intended mainly to calm markets BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone ministers will discuss on Tuesday the possibility of governments applying for a credit line from the bloc’s bailout fund to fight the coronavirus crisis, a move that would also pave the way for unlimited ECB bond purchases if needed. Finance ministers and the European Central Bank have a teleconference at 1730 GMT but officials cautioned it was unclear if decisions could be taken now or if they would require the input of EU leaders who hold talks on Thursday. Euro zone officials are worried that as the pandemic spreads and the euro zone sinks into a deep recession this year, financial markets could start demanding a high price for lending to governments, putting some of the most highly indebted countries like Italy under a lot of strain. The idea under consideration is therefore that either all, or most, euro zone countries would apply for a precautionary stand-by credit called the Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the bailout fund, which has an unused lending capacity of 410 billion euros. Governments would not draw on the ESM credit, but hold it in reserve to keep sovereign bond yields at manageable levels when they finance themselves on the market, because investors would know governments have a cheap financing alternative. Crucially, an ECCL would open the way for the European Central Bank to step in with unlimited bond purchases, if it deemed this necessary. The ECB is allowed to do so for the bonds of any country with such a credit line, under its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme created in 2012. One of the difficulties in agreeing on the standby credit option on Tuesday is the conditions attached to it - any country applying would face a debt sustainability analysis by the European Commission. Italy, which has a public debt of 137% of GDP that is only likely to grow given the country is likely to get into a recession this year, is unhappy about EU institutions scrutinising its debt. The ECCL would also have to entail other conditions, some of which could be politically problematic. To make them more palatable, officials say they could be tightly focused on issues relating to the epidemic, rather than general macroeconomic problems, and introduced gradually or with a delay. Yet, Italy, Greece and Spain insist the credit line from the ESM should be without any conditions, while Germany, Finland, the Netherlands or Austria, say money cannot be lent with no strings attached. “I wouldn’t hold my breath,” one senior euro zone official said of the likelihood of a decision being taken on Tuesday. “Discussions are ongoing but the usual suspects (southern and northern euro zone countries) are not aligned yet on the best way forward.” Officials also note that the urgency of a decision has been diminished by the ECB’s own coronavirus emergency bond-buying programme worth 750 billion euros and the fact that all euro zone governments can still borrow very cheaply on the market.
