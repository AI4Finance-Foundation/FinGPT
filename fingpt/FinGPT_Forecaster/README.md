## What is FinGPT-Forecaster?
- FinGPT-Forecaster takes market news and optional basic financials related to the specified company from the past few weeks as input and responds with the company's **positive developments** and **potential concerns**. Then it gives out a **prediction** of stock price movement for the coming week and its **analysis** summary.
- FinGPT-Forecaster is finetuned on Llama-2-7b-chat-hf with LoRA on the past year's DOW30 market data. But also has shown great generalization ability on other ticker symbols.
- FinGPT-Forecaster is an easy-to-deploy junior robo-advisor, a milestone towards our goal.
