# FinGPT-V1 series (Labeled by the Market)

## Ⅰ. What is FinGPT-V1 series

* FinGPT-V1 is a series of LoRA model for financial sentiment analysis whose labels are generated by the change of market (stock price). 
* You can also say these models are analyzing or predicting the market through related alternative data (news, social media, filings, etc,).

## Ⅱ. Why label by the market

* Labeling has always been a big issue in the ever-changing financial market, labeling by the market is more efficient and economic than human labor (not necessarily better).
* Human's opinion on the market is sometimes biased. Since our final goal is to analyze or predict the market, why not let the model learn directly from the market.
